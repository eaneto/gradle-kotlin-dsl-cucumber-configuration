Example of how to configure cucumber and jacoco using Gradle 8+ with the Kotlin DSL.

## Why?

Almost all the content explaining how to configure cucumber with gradle 5+ uses
groovy as the language for the build script. As I'm using Kotlin for my new projects,
I decided to create an example build for future projects, and hope to help someone.
I'm also using jacoco for test coverage, so there's also a simple configuration
for that.
